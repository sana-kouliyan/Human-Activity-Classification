# Human Activity Classification

This repository contains a machine learning notebook for **classifying human activities** using sensor-based data.

## Project Features

* Data loading and preprocessing
* Feature engineering and normalization
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Building classification models
* Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

## Project Structure

* **human_activity_classification.ipynb** — Main notebook with all analysis and model development

## DataSet

Source of the dataset is QUERA.

## Techniques Used

* Pandas, NumPy for data processing
* Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualizations
* Machine learning models (DecisionTreeClassifier, Random Forest)

## Project Goal

To build an accurate model that can classify human activities (such as walking, standing, sitting, etc.) using recorded sensor signals.

## Project Status

This project is for practice and can be used as a **data science and machine learning portfolio project** on GitHub.
